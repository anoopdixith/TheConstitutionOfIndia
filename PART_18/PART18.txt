of the whole of India or of such part of the territory thereof as may be specified
in the Proclamation.
Explanation.—A Proclamation of Emergency declaring that the security

is imminent danger thereof.
(2) A Proclamation issued under clause (1) may be varied or revoked by
a subsequent Proclamation.

Ministers of Cabinet rank appointed under article 75) that such a Proclamation
may be issued has been communicated to him in writing.
(4) Every Proclamation issued under this article shall be laid before each
House of Parliament and shall, except where it is a Proclamation revoking a

Provided that if any such Proclamation (not being a Proclamation
revoking a previous Proclamation) is issued at a time when the House of the
People has been dissolved, or the dissolution of the House of the People takes
