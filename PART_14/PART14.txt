of a civil service of the Union or an all-India service or a civil service of a
State or holds a civil post under the Union or a State shall be dismissed or
removed by an authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed.
(2) No such person as aforesaid shall be dismissed or removed or
reduced in rank except after an inquiry in which he has been informed of the
charges against him and given a reasonable opportunity of being heard in
respect of those charges:
Provided that where it is proposed after such inquiry, to impose upon
him any such penalty, such penalty may be imposed on the basis of the
evidence adduced during such inquiry and it shall not be necessary to give such
person any opportunity of making representation on the penalty proposed:
Provided further that this clause shall not apply—
(a) where a person is dismissed or removed or reduced in rank on
the ground of conduct which has led to his conviction on a criminal
charge; or

or to reduce him in rank is satisfied that for some reason, to be recorded

supported by not less than two-thirds of the members present and voting that it
is necessary or expedient in the national interest so to do, Parliament may by
law provide for the creation of one or more all India services (including an allIndia judicial service) common to the Union and the States, and, subject to the
other provisions of this Chapter, regulate the recruitment, and the conditions of
service of persons appointed, to any such service.

the office of the Chief Justice or other Judge of the Supreme Court or a High
Court, the Comptroller and Auditor-General of India, the Chairman or other
member of the Union or a State Public Service Commission or the Chief
Election Commissioner, nothing in sub-clause (a) or sub-clause (b) shall be
construed as empowering Parliament to vary or revoke, after his appointment
to such post, the conditions of his service to his disadvantage except in so far as
such conditions of service are applicable to him by reason of his being a
person appointed by the Secretary of State or Secretary of State in Council to a
civil service of the Crown in India.
